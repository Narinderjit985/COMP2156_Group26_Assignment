DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry
 Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.[1] DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of working.
 Other than it being a cross-functional combination (and a portmanteau) of the terms and concepts for "development" and "operations", academics and practitioners have not developed a universal definition for the term "DevOps".
