DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry
 Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.[1] DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of working.
 Other than it being a cross-functional combination (and a portmanteau) of the terms and concepts for "development" and "operations", academics and practitioners have not developed a universal definition for the term "DevOps".
 Most often, DevOps is characterized by key principles: shared ownership, workflow automation, and rapid feedback.
 In 2009, the first conference named devopsdays was held in Ghent, Belgium.
 DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps to allow for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach.
 Contrary to a traditional centralized security team model, each delivery team is empowered to factor in the correct security controls into their software delivery.
